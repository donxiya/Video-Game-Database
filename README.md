For the group project we decided to create an app that will retrieve information for a video game as well as a video.  A Twitch API was also incorporated that will retreive the top viewed games of the day. The Giant Bomb API was used to retreive the video game information while Youtube API for the videos.  To use the app simply search for a game and all the relative information for it will be displayed. The top 5 games of the day will be displayed right away. To see the videos for the searched game just click the videos tab and a click on a video to watch.
